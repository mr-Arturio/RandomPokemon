Here is a little exercise where we practice using the basic ```React``` concepts. Followind this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course
**Random Pokemon**  -  show us different Pokemon images, every time the page refreshes we get a different Pokemon number and the corresponding image.
___
We practice:
* Create a new React app using the following command: ```npx create-react-app <name>```
* Create JS and CSS files as needed for your project. You can create separate files for different components or functionality
* Remove all unused files.
* In your JS files, import and export the necessary files using the import and export statements. This allows you to use functions, components, or variables defined in one file in another file
* Utilize the Math.random() function as needed in your code.
* Use URL to display imgs
* Apply CSS styles to your components to achieve the desired visual appearance.

Very basic and simple.
